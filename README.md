## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aditya, a student at UCSD and an incoming intern at the Department of Defense.

Iâ€™m currently building in the AI space. I co-built CallToChange, an award-winning AI infrastructure app. I also built ucsdGPT, a RAG app used 2000+ times by UCSD students.

I am the cofounder of Herd Health, a funded startup. We were initially building in the agtech space, but my team and I are pivoting. I am actively looking to discuss any problems you face, no matter what industry you work in.

In the past, I interned at the USDA and an AI startup. I also launched my first business while I was in high school (digital marketing for nonprofits). At one point, I managed $800,000/year in ad spend. In addition, I am an Eagle Scout.

Currently looking for internships for Fall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025, with interests in software engineering and data engineering projects.
