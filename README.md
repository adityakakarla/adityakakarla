## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aditya, a data science student at UCSD.

Iâ€™m currently building in the AI space. I co-built CallToChange, an award-winning AI infrastructure app. I also built ucsdGPT, a RAG app used 2000+ times by UCSD students.

I am currently interning at the Department of Defense and at EyePop.ai, a computer vision startup. In the past, I interned at the USDA and an AI startup. I also launched my first business while I was in high school (digital marketing for nonprofits). At one point, I managed $800,000/year in ad spend. In addition, I'm an Eagle Scout.

Currently looking for internships for Fall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025, with interests in software engineering and data engineering projects.
