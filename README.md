## Hey there 👋

I'm Aditya, a data science student at UCSD.

I’m currently building in the AI space. Currently working on using LLMs to automate bioinformatics data pipelines at UCSD's Mesirov Lab.

I co-built CallToChange, an award-winning AI infrastructure app. I also built ucsdGPT, a RAG app used 2000+ times by UCSD students.

In the past, I interned at EyePop.ai (venture-backed CV startup), the Department of Defense, the Department of Agriculture, and an AI startup. I also launched my first business while I was in high school (digital marketing for nonprofits). At one point, I managed $800,000/year in ad spend. In addition, I'm an Eagle Scout.

Currently looking for internships for Spring 2025 and Summer 2025, with interests in software engineering and data engineering projects.
